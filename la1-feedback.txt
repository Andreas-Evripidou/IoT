Hello Andreas Evripidou!

My records state that you're not in a pair.

(If this is incorrect please get in touch!)

We've reviewed your COM3505 assessment 1 from
https://gitlab.com/eandreas1/com3505-student-2024

Congratulations, you've passed!

As you know, we don't provide marks for this part of the course
assessment, but if we _were_ doing so, we would estimate your work to
be somewhere in the 3rd quartile.

That's good work.

Some feedback: You've put together a comprehensive IoT project that aligns
well with the assignment rubric, especially in illustrating the provisioning
and over-the-air update functions using an ESP32 board. The use of LEDs
to indicate different stages of those functions is a smart choice, effectively
providing visual feedback which is crucial for understanding the state of the
device. Your documentation is reasonably thorough and well-structured, making it easy
to follow the setup and usage of the device. The substitution of a push button
for the touch sensor functionality due to hardware issues is a reasonable
adjustment and is well documented.
