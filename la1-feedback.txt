Hello Andreas Evripidou!

My records state that you're not in a pair.

(If this is incorrect please get in touch!)

We've reviewed your COM3505 assessment 1 from
https://gitlab.com/eandreas1/com3505-student-2024

Unfortunately it did not meet the minimum standard for the assessment so you
have failed this (threshold) element of the course :(

Please get in touch to discuss. Thanks, Hamish
